## Background


Although humans have been reading for several thousand years and studying reading for more than a century, the mechanisms governing the acquisition, use and breakdown of this skill continue to be the subject of considerable interest and controversy...

Reading development could be considered as a complex system across different levels in which other complex systems embedded.

Why it is important? The practical reasons is about how reading should be taught. See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_reading:_whole_language_and_phonics) for the Reading Wars.


Researchers in reading research investigate both typical and atypical reading development. Two levels: word reading and reading comprehension. Here we focus on word reading.


## Computational Model of Reading


There are many theories relating to development of word reading but fewer can be simulated computationally. See [here](http://www.cogsci.mq.edu.au/~ssaunder/DRC/) for the Dual Route Cascaded (DRC) Model of Visual Word Recognition and Reading Aloud as an example.

The DRC model is largely inspired by clinical observations. Based on the philosophy of symbolism, this model argues against connectionism for which artificial neural networks are important tools.


Now look at this connectionist model:

</figure>

 The key point is that it assumes some general architecture, algorithm, or other principles in modeling reading development.
 
 
 "Smith’s argument about the difﬁculties involved in using phonological mediation rests on the assumption that spelling-sound correspondences are **encoded by rules**. Connectionist models such as Seidenberg and McClelland’s (1989) subsequently provided an alternative in which the correspondences are **encoded by weights on connections between units** involved in the orthography-phonology mapping."


Some issues:   
  1) Localist vs Distributed Representations: accessing vs computing;   
  2) Attractor structures;


1) reading development could be a prerequisite for good academic achievement and 2) there is a group of children who fail to develop typical reading skills. 

Reading is one of human higher cognitive functions 
Although learning to read seems effortless for most of us, it is still far from fully understanding the nature of reading. Like other human higher cognitive functions, the picutre of reading development mechanism is so complex there is .
